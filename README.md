**Description**
  
I have chosen to create the News Explorer Full Stack Application that is interacting with the NewsAPI API. This was an enjoyable project for me, I gained confidence in what I have learnt throughout the whole Bootcamp.

**Technologies and  techniques**  
  
I have used Flexbox, React Hooks, Components, Contexts and fetching news articles from the NewsAPI making asynchronous GET requests to return news data.
I like to create a Utility file that handles miscellaneous functions. I have also implemented a "hamburger" mobile menu.

Thank you for taking the time to review my project!
